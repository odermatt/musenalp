<h3>MuSenALP Processsor</h3>
<p>The MuSenALP Processor takes remote sensing data from various satellite instruments as input and generates image products containing Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) plus quality indicators as output. The processor works on single input data files, corresponding to one overflight of the satellite on a given day and time (so called L1 product), and generates one corresponding LSWT output file (so called L2 product).</p>
