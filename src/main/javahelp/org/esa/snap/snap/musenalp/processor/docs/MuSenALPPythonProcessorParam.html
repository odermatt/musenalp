<h3>MuSenALP Gui Parameters</h3>
<center><img src="images/processor-parameter.gif" border="0"></center>
<p>Parameters need to be entered in the GUI of the processor. </p>
<h4>Type of Sensor</h4>
<p>The type of sensor of the source product can be chosen. Depending on this choice the bands used for the calculation
    will be chosen. For some of the sensors it is necessary to load additional files with auxillary data. The different
    sensors, the chosen bands and the auxillary data, if any, can be found in the table below.
</p>
<p>The sensor gives the information which bands should be used for the calculation of LSWT and the quality flags. Each
    sensor has different names for the relevant bands.
    The relevant bands are:

        Unix: /home/&lt;user&gt;)
    </li>
    <li>In this file define the necessary bands and angle definitions in the following form:<br>
        <p class="ini">
            <code>[bands]<br>

    </li>
    <li>Restart SNAP. Now the newly defined bands will be used for the calculations.</li>

<h4>Cloud mask</h4>
<p>To add a cloud mask two input fields are available:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>cloud mask: optional additional product</td>
        <td>If your mask or band containing the data for cloud recognition is not part of the source product, an
            additional product can be entered here. <br>This field is optional. If there is a product entered the
            resolution of the bands needs to be the same as for the source product.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cloud mask: mask or band</td>
        <td>Here the mask or band or band math expression containing the data for cloud recognition can be entered.
            Masks and bands from the
            source product or from the additional product entered in the field above are possible.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>If no source for a cloud mask is entered the target product will be treated as if there were clouds at all pixels.
    This will lead to a low quality index.</p>
<h4>Land-water mask</h4>
<p>Analog to the cloud mask, the land-water mask has two input fields, too.</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>land-water mask: optional additional product</td>
        <td>If your mask or band containing the data for water recognition is not part of the source product, an
            additional product can be entered here. <br>This field is optional. If there is a product entered the
            resolution of the bands needs to be the same as for the source product.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>land-water mask: mask or band</td>
        <td>Here the mask or band or band math expression containing the data for water recognition can be entered.
            Masks and bands from the
            source product or from the additional product entered in the field above are possible.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Calculate LWM</td>
        <td>If no land-water mask is given for the source it is possible to check this option. The SNAP
            internal LandWaterMask Operator is then used to first calculate a land water mask and then use this newly
            created mask for calculation of the quality levels.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>If no source for a land-water mask is entered and the option "Calculate LWM" is not checked the target product will
    be treated as if there was land on all pixels. This will lead to a low quality index.</p>
<h4>Apply Masks before calculation</h4>
<p>As it can take some time for this processor to run (especially if the coefficients are calculated by LUT), it can
    speed up the process to only calculate the pixels that are not masked out by land-water- or cloud-mask. If this
    checkbox is checked LSWT is calculated only for not masked pixels. It can be unchecked if LSWT should be calculated
    for all pixels.</p>
<p>As a standard this checkbox is marked.</p>
<h4>Valid Pixel Expression</h4>
<p>In this field it is possible to enter a band, mask or bandmath expression to define which pixels should be valid. All
    non valid pixels will be set to NaN, LSWT will not be calculated for these pixels.</p>
<p> An empyt value for this field
    will evaluate to "True", i.e. all pixels will be valid.</p>
<h4>Algorithm</h4>
<p>This processor can calculate LSWT using two different algorithms: The split-window algorithm and the mono-window
    algorithm.</p>
<p>The split-window algorithm uses the data of two channels with brightness temperatures, the mono-window algorithm only
    of one channel.</p>
<p>Detailed information regarding the coefficients and input values can be found <a
        href="MuSenALPPythonSplitWindow.html">here for the split-window algorithm</a> and <a
        href="MuSenALPPythonMonoWindow.html">here for the mono-window algorithm</a>.</p>
<h4>Subset</h4>
<p>It is possible to specify a point of interest and the padding that should be applied into each direction. If this
    option is selected, the LSWT and quality masks will only be calculated in this area. The target product will only
    contain this subset of the data. </p>
<p>At the moment, this is implemented for the AVHRR sensor. For other sensors, the already implemented subset processor
    of SNAP can be used in preprocessing. </p>
<h4>Additional option bands</h4>
<p>The user can choose an option to add additional bands from the source product to the target product. </p>
<p>The additional bands have to be added separated by semicolon (;)</p>
