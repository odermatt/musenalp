<h3>LSWT Mono-Window Algorithm</h3>
<p>With this algorithm a linear regression is used to calculate LSWT from one band of brightness temperature. </p>
<center>T<sub>LSWT</sub> = a<sub>0</sub> BT + a<sub>1</sub>
</center>
<br>
<p>To reach the highest possible quality for this approach for each observation the radiative transfer needs to be
    calculated. For this calculation, the RTTOV and the current atmospheric conditions are necessary. This depends on
    access to RTTOV and NRT at ECMWF. Both is not given in this processor. </p>
<p>Therefore, look-up tables (LUT) for mean atmospheric states, 5° steps for view angles and different elevations were
    calculated. The user only needs to enter the approximate elevation of the desired target area.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is possible to directly enter the coefficients a<sub>0</sub> and a<sub>1</sub> in the GUI in the
    fields "coefficient a0 (mono-window)" and "coefficient a1 (mono-window)". If data is entered here, the LUT will not
    be used.</p>
