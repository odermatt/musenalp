<h3>LSWT Split-Window Algorithm</h3>
<p>The idea of the split-window approach is to make use of the different absorption characteristics of water vapor
    within differential spectral windows of the thermal infrared spectra. A simple formula combining two TIR bands and
    the view zenith angle is applied to compute the surface temperature.<br>
    The formula can e.g. be found in the GCOS Report, which is the final report for the project "Oberflächentemperaturen
    von Schweizer Seen aus NOAA-AVHRR Daten (1989-2010)", by Riffler and Wunderle (2012)<br>
    <br>
</p>
<center>T<sub>LSWT</sub> = a<sub>0</sub>+a<sub>1</sub> BT<sub>4</sub>+a<sub>2</sub> (BT<sub>4</sub>-BT<sub>5</sub>
    )+a<sub>3</sub> (1-sec &theta;) (BT<sub>4</sub>-BT<sub>5</sub>)
</center>
<br>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>a<sub>(0..3)</sub></td>
        <td>Split-window coefficients</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>BT<sub>4,5</sub></td>
        <td>Brightness temperature in AVHRR bands 4 (10.30 - 11.30 &mu;m) and 5 (11.50 - 12.50 &mu;m)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&theta;</td>
        <td>The satellite's view zenith angle</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    <br>
    As the zenith angle is mostly given in degree, it has to be converted to rad:<br>
    <br>
</p>
<center>1 rad = <sup>&pi;</sup>/<sub>180°</sub> 1°</center>
<p>
    <br>
    This results in the implemented formula<br>
    <br>
</p>
<center>
    T<sub>LSWT</sub> = a<sub>0</sub>+a<sub>1</sub> BT<sub>4</sub>+a<sub>2</sub> (BT<sub>4</sub>-BT<sub>5</sub>
    )+a<sub>3</sub> (1-1/cos(&theta;&pi;/180° ) (BT<sub>4</sub>-BT<sub>5</sub>)
</center>

<h4>Input of coefficients</h4>
<p>
    The Split-Window Algorithm algorithm for calculating LSWT needs four coefficients (a<sub>0</sub> to a<sub>3</sub> in
    the above formulas). This processor provides different possibilities to enter these coefficients:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Coefficients from File</td>
        <td>A path to a file containing the coefficients can be provided. This input has the highest priority. The
            formatting of the file should be like shown here:
            <img src="images/split-window-coef-file.gif" border="0"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Lookup-table (globally approximated coefficients)</td>
        <td>A lookup-table (LUT) with globally approximated coefficients is provided and can be used for the
            calculation. Checking this option has second highest priority (after providing a coefficient file). <b>needs
                to be implemented!</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Direct user input</td>
        <td>The user can directly write the four coefficients in the provided fields. This input has the lowest
            priority
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p><br>
    Technically it is possible to enter data in all three of these options. The selected option with the highest
    priority will be chosen. The other inputs are ignored.<br>
